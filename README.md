# R2D2-Mkiii-back-panel-for-cut-version
Modified Cut files for R2D2 mkiii to use full back panel from uncut version
I have modified the stls from the cut version of the r2d2 mkiii body so that they fit the full back panel from the uncut version
The main files are on the one drive - in the cut version for mainbody 2 and mainbody 3 and the full version for back panel
For mainbody 2, mainbodyb and mainbodyd needed modifying and mainbody c is no longer needed
For mainbody 3, mainbody d needs modifying
So you print mainbody2a, revised mainbody2b, revisedmainbody2d and mainbody2e
And then mainbody 3a, mainbody3b, mainbody3c, revisedmainbody3d, mainbody3e and mainbody3f
And then back panel - from the onedrive mkiii version with backpanel folder
You will need to get the normal files above from the onedrive
